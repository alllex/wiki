https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell

## Installation

macOS:

```sh
brew install fish
```

It's immediately runnable after installation:

```sh
fish
```

### Making it a default 

See where Fish is installed (it might be different between macOS versions)

```sh
which fish
/opt/homebrew/bin/fish
```

```sh
echo /opt/homebrew/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/fish
```

## Customization

Fish is a shell that is much better equipped by default compared to other shells.
